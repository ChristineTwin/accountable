# ACCOUNTABLE - Project Proposal

## Inspiration
This idea emerged as I was reading 'Accountable' which was highlighting the increasing reporting demands on federal funding as well as from my experience as a PM at a small non-profit managing federal, state, and foundation grants. While trying to accomplish project work, I also spent countless hours per month on tracking, reporting, and reconciling numbers with others across the organization. This outcome is not because the reporting itself is an unreasonable expectation. We should be held accountable for funds and how we are using them. Instead, I think the tools we were using were inadequate. Our accounting system, development database, and project tracking tools never agreed with each other, requiring constant manual reconciliation and deciding where the one truth was. In addition, it was frustrating and disempowering as a PM when accounting staff questioned spending decisions without understanding the work or the funder. Federal reporting requirements may be seen as a burden, but the solution isn't less accountability. The solution is better tools. Funders deserve to know their money is being spent appropriately and achieving outcomes. The burden comes from using disconnected systems that create manual work, not from the reporting itself. I am proposing a tool that puts everything in one place and leverages already existing tools like task management tools and weekly check ins to quickly capture the relevant information about the work.

## Core Concept
AI-powered grant management platform that is a hub to synthesize weekly narrative reports and personel hours tracking into organized draft report materials while learning project-specific patterns over time.

## Target Users
- Research institutions (universities, labs)
- Non-profits managing federal/foundation grants
- Any organization with documentation-heavy funding sources

## Problem Statement
Managing federal awards and similar funding requires tracking:
- Budget spending vs. approved amounts across multiple categories
- Personnel effort allocation and compliance with approved amounts
- Progress on deliverables and specific aims
- Regular reporting to funders with different requirements

Currently, these elements exist in separate systems (email updates, spreadsheets, accounting software, project management tools). Project managers spend hours manually synthesizing information into reports, often working from memory or digging through months of scattered communications.

## Solution Overview
**Accountable** streamlines grant management by:
1. **Collecting** structured weekly narrative updates and hours from staff via simple forms
2. **Processing** with AI to extract activities, map to deliverables, and classify costs
3. **Learning** from user corrections to improve accuracy over time
4. **Reporting** organized bullet points and data summaries for PMs to refine into final reports along with financial reports by funder and by project

**Philosophy**: Reporting and accountability are important but it can and should be simpler. Automate the tedious collection and organization work (80%), preserve PM judgment and expertise for final report crafting (20%).


## Minimum Viable Product - Class Project Scope

### Data Input

#### Initial Project Setup (One-Time)

**Project Setup Form - Four Sections:**

**Section 1: Project Basics**
- Project name (text input)
- Description (text area)
- Poject code or nickname? 
- Start date (date picker)
- End date (date picker)

**Section 2: Funders** (dynamic - can add multiple)
- "Add Funder" button (can add/remove rows)
- For each funder:
  - Funder name (text input)
  - Funder type (dropdown: Federal, Foundation, Corporate, Internal, Other)
  - Total amount (dollar input)
  - Award number (text input, optional)

**Section 3: Deliverables/Objectives** (dynamic - can add multiple)
- "Add Deliverable" button (can add/remove rows)
- For each deliverable:
  - Description (text area)
  - Due date (date picker)
  - **Checkboxes for which funders require this deliverable** (auto-populated from Section 2)
  - Funder notes field (text area): "e.g., Funder A wants 25 classrooms, Funder B wants 12 classrooms"

**Section 4: Budget** (dynamic - PER FUNDER option)

For each funder (tabs or sections for each option? could just have one budget). If each funder has their own budget with their own line items, the total project budget is the sum across all funders.

**Personnel Lines:**
- "Add Personnel Line" button
- For each personnel line:
  - Line item code (text input, e.g., "P001")
  - Employee name (text input or dropdown)
  - Description/purpose (text input, e.g., "PI - 50% effort")
  - Total amount (dollar input)
  - Total hours available (autogenerated based on hourly rate)

**Other Budget Lines:**
- "Add Budget Line" button
- For each budget line:
  - Category (dropdown: Supplies, Equipment, Travel, Overhead, Other)
  - Line item code (autogenerated from categoy, e.g., "SUP-01")
  - Description/purpose (text input)
  - Total amount (dollar input)


#### Editing Project Details (Long-Term Feature)

**Edit Project Page:**
- Access from dashboard or project settings
- Can modify any section:
  - Add/remove/edit funders
  - Add/remove/edit deliverables
  - Update deliverable-funder relationships
  - Add/remove/edit budget lines per funder
  - Adjust personnel hours allocations

**Use cases:**
- Project receives additional funding from new funder
- Budget gets revised or supplemented
- New deliverables added mid-project
- Personnel changes (someone leaves, new hire)

#### Ongoing Weekly Input

**Weekly Report Form** (simple, quick entry)
- Employee selector (dropdown of people on this project)
- Week ending date (date picker, defaults to current week)
- Hours worked this week (number input)
- "What did you work on this week?" (text area for narrative)
- Submit button

**Workflow:**
- Each team member fills out weekly (1-2 minutes)
- OR PM acts as note-taker during weekly team meeting
- Creates structured reflection point and institutional memory

### AI Processing

**Natural language processing:**
- Extracts activities and accomplishments from narrative text
- Maps activities to specific grant deliverables/objectives
- Proposes how to allocate reported hours across deliverables
- Flags items that can't be confidently mapped for manual assignment

**Direct vs. Indirect cost classification:**
- Distinguishes direct costs (tied to specific deliverables)
- Identifies indirect/overhead activities (lab maintenance, general administration)
- Learns project-specific classification patterns over time

**Machine learning from corrections:**
- Stores all user corrections and manual assignments
- Builds project-specific vocabulary and classification patterns
- Increases confidence and reduces manual work over time
- Learns synonyms and context-specific meanings

### Report Outputs

**Automated warnings and flags:**
- Spending approaching or exceeding approved budget by line item
- Personnel hours approaching or exceeding total allocation (across all funders)
- Personnel effort percentages not matching approved commitments
- Deliverables not mentioned in updates for multiple weeks
- Activities falling behind expected timelines

**Budget summaries:**
- Can view by funder (their budget lines only)
- Can view project-wide (sum across all funders)
- Approved vs. actual spending by line item
- Personnel cost tracking tied to deliverables
- Hours utilization by person (across all their funding sources)

**PM role:** Takes organized bullets and data summaries, crafts into polished narrative reports tailored to each funder's requirements.
